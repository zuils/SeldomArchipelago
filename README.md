# Usage
To play using this branch, you must generate and host a game **using the packaged `.apworld` found on the releases page**, and subscribe to (or manually install) the corresponding tModLoader mods.
**The workshop mod will NOT work with a YAML generated from the website.**
## Generating a Game
This process is identical to that of most custom games:
1. Download the .apworld and place it in the `custom_worlds` directory of your Archipelago installation.
2. Launch `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` and click `Generate Template YAMLs` in the menu.
- This should open the `Players/Templates` folder that should contain a new `Terraria Beta.yaml` file for configuration.
3. Configure this file, save a copy, and place it in the `Players` directory, along with whichever `.yaml` files you want to generate with.
4. Navigate back to `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` and click `Generate`.
5. Find the resulting `.zip` file in the `output` directory. From there, you can host the game easily on `archipelago.gg`.
## Installing the Mod
The simplest way to install the mod is to subscribe to it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3676602360).
Alternatively, you can download the `SeldomArchipelagoBeta.tmod` file in the corresponding release and place that in C:/Users/**YourPCName**/Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/Mods.
## Connecting to a Game
1. Launch tModLoader, navigate to Workshop > Manage Mods, and check to see if Archipelago Randomizer (Desp's Beta) is properly installed.
2. Configure the server address, port, slot/player name, password as necessary, and the rest to your liking.
3. Launch a world (creating a new one is recommended). If the chat displays "Archipelago is Active," you are connected successfully!

# About This Fork

# Feature Explanation
## NPC Randomization
NPC Randomization is a setting you can enable in your `.yaml` prior to generating a multiworld.
If enabled: 
- The ability for each vanilla town NPC to move in becomes an item.
- Finding and talking to a rescuable NPC (Sleeping Angler, Bound Goblin, etc.) is a location.
- Meeting the conditions for an NPC to move in (barring receiving them as an AP item) and speaking to the resultant Ghost NPC is a location.
As of now, these only apply to vanilla Town NPCs that are not pets or wandering merchants.
### Notes
For a ghost or rescuable NPC to spawn, you need to meet the conditions that it would normally spawn under in an Archipelago randomizer.
For example, the Clothier ghost will move in after receiving the Post-Skeletron item, *not* after defeating Skeletron.
The Bound Tinkerer will appear after receiving Post-Goblin Army, *not* after defeating it in-game.

A real NPC will only move in if the corresponding item is received (you need the "Merchant" item for the Merchant to move in, etc.)

Both the real Truffle and the ghost Truffle will only spawn in a glowing mushroom field.
## New goals
These are additional goals you can enable in your `.yaml` prior to generating a multiworld.
- Wall of Flesh
- Princess
### Wall of Flesh
Victory is earned once the Wall of Flesh is summoned and defeated.
Note that this is intended for use with NPC randomization. It is strongly recommended you do not enable this goal with NPC randomization disabled, as this will result in an immediately beatable game.
### Princess
Victory is earned once the requirements for the Princess is met (all Vanilla town NPCs move in besides Santa Claus & Town Pets).
This goal randomizes everything up to and including Plantera. While created with NPC Randomization in mind, it is also perfectly playable otherwise.
## "Shuffle To" Configuration
This option is present in your `.yaml` and allows you to shuffle checks *past* your set goal.
For example, setting it to 'Moon Lord' will randomize all checks up to Moon Lord, even if an earlier boss is chosen for the goal.
### Notes
- Certain configurations may result in 'post-game' checks, or checks that are only accessible after the goal condition is reached.
- This option can *not* be set to a boss earlier than the chosen goal. If it is, the generator will simply ignore this option.
## Additional Achievement Classifications
The following achievement classifications are added and can be toggled in the `.yaml`:
- Rare: Achievements involving rare enemies/drops
- Time: Achievements based on random time-based events
- Crafting: Achievements dedicated to crafting complex items
### Notes
Some achievements may fall into multiple categories.
- For example, 'The Great Slime Mitosis' will only be shuffled if both 'Rare' and 'Time' are enabled, as it requires both the spawn of a rare NPC (mystic frog for mystic slime) and the occurance of a random event (natural party for cool slime).

Additionally, the logic for some achievements may change depending on which categories are enabled.
- For example, 'Kill the Sun' requires access to a solar tablet *unless* 'Time' is enabled, in which case it only requires the conditions for a naturally spawning eclipse to be met.
## Shimmer Logic Toggle
Sequence breaks involving shimmer transmutations can now be disabled or enabled in the `.yaml`.
If disabled, all transmutations or decrafting using Shimmer are disregarded in logic.
### Notes
This option only covers optional transmutations via Shimmer. The player may still be expected to utilize the Shimmer when mandatory, i.e. transmuting a sparkle slime balloon into the diva slime.
## Health Logic
The randomizer considers a maximum health requirement for each boss, requiring access to prior health upgrades depending on their intended stage of progression in vanilla.
### Notes
- This option is intended for use with Calamity, and guarantees that early bosses like Leviathan & Anahita and Primordial Wyrm will not have to be fought with extremely inadequate gear.
  - It is ON by default.
- All amounts are based off [the walkthrough from the official Calamity wiki](https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Mod_progression).
- Currently, each boss's health requirement cannot be fine-tuned. However, there is an additional handicap setting that allows you to decrease how many different types of max HP upgrades are needed for each boss.
  - For example, with Calamity enabled, setting the handicap to -2 would remove both the Sanguine Tangerine and Life Fruit requirement for Plantera, while Yharon would only require Life Crystals, Fruits, and one Calamity health upgrade (chosen between Sanguine Tangerine, Miracle Fruit, or Tainted Cloudberry)
## Advanced Manual Flag Configuration
Accessible through the client-side mod's config.
This expands upon the "Hardmode Starter" option in stable by allowing all vanilla & Calamity flags to be set for manual activation.
Setting a flag for manual activation means that once you receive the item, you gain the ability to trigger the corresponding item instead of it activating manually.
### Notes
**This option allows you to opt out of receiving flags like Hardmode too early and making early-game difficult. Please make sure to configure it before entering a world.**
Some good examples of flags to set as manual are Hardmode, Post-Plantera (for the dungeon changes especially) and Post-Moon Lord (which, in Calamity, adds incredibly tough enemies to the Hallow and Underworld).
## Advanced AP Chat Configuration
Accessible through the client-side mod's config.
Provides the ability to toggle the color and visibility of AP messages unrelated to your world.
